Capturing Waves

In theory it sounds pretty simple: Find a got spot, where the waves won't hit you, set up your camera and tripod and find the right exposure time in order to get the desired effect. But when out in the wild it can be quite a task to do all these things while the light is running out or your girlfriend is impatiently waiting for you.
